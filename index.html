            <h3>Spider Man's Powers</h3>
            <p>Spider-Man has spider-like abilities including superhuman strength and the ability to cling to most
                surfaces.
                He is also extremely agile and has amazing reflexes. Spider-Man also has a “spider sense,” that warns
                him of
                impending danger.</p>

            <p> American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan, is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result
                of
                the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility, along with the ability to cling to
                walls,
                turning him into Spider-Man.</p>

            <p>Writers and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man,
                in comics and in other media. As with the hero, the majority of the villains' powers originate with
                scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or
                powers. The most notable Spider-Man villains are listed down below in the ordering of their original
                chronological appearance:</p>

            <h2 class="orange-color">Romantic interests</h2>
            <p>Peter Parker's romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student Liz Allan, to
                having his first date with Betty Brant, secretary to the Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah
                Jameson. After his breakup with Betty Brant, Parker eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend
                Gwen Stacy, daughter of New York City Police Department detective captain George Stacy, both of whom are
                later killed by supervillain enemies of Spider-Man. Mary Jane Watson eventually became Peter's best
                friend and then his wife. Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat, is a reformed cat burglar who had been
                Spider-Man's sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point.</p>
